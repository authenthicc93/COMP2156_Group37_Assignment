Learning DevOps is crucial in the software development cycle as it bridges the gap between development and operations, enabling faster, more efficient, and reliable software delivery.
 By automating workflows, continuous integration, and deployment, DevOps enhances collaboration, reduces errors, and improves system stability. It also ensures rapid feedback loops, allowing teams to detect and fix 
issues early in the development process. With the growing demand for scalable and high-performance applications, mastering DevOps practices helps developers streamline processes, optimize resources, and accelerate time-to-market, 
making it an essential skill in modern software engineering.
